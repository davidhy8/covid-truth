# covid-truth
These scripts were designed to obtain COVID-19 related data from various countries across the world and group the data by month. Epidemiological model and serology studies were used to estimate the "true" prevelance of COVID-19 around world. Meanwhile, sequence sampling suggestions for GISAID are also made in the pipeline. The output file "country_ideal_sequences.csv" can be directly used in the Nybbler repository (https://github.com/nodrogluap/nybbler) to perform weighted sampling. See the paper attached in the description of the repository for more information.
